This repository contains the code employed for testing purposes of the paper "An Optimized Multiparametric Spaced Repetition Model for Improved Memorability".

## Language & Packages
We employ Python and Cython to devise the logic of every program written. Some external packages are also utilised. These are versions installed:

- `Python`: 3.11.1
- `Cython`: 0.29.33
- `matplotlib`: 3.6.2
- `numpy`: 1.24.0
- `pandas`: 1.5.2

In order to effectively install Cython, it's not enough to run `pip3 install Cython`, but you also need C Build Tools installed in your computer. For detailed guidelines on installation, you can visit the official [web page](https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/quickstart/install.html).
